# mega65-devtools
Development tools for the MEGA65 retro-computer

Currently this is more of a place-holder, but the following are planned at present.

1. Partial emulator (CPU and some video functionality) for development and digital screen-capture.
2. sub-modules pointing to supported compilers (Ophis for now, until k2asm adds MEGA65 support).
